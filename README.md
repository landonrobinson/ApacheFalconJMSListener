Pigeon - An Apache Falcon JMS Listener
=================
A open source, lightweight Java client that asynchronously listens for and fetches JMS messages sent by Apache Falcon via an MQ service. Built for use with Apache Hadoop and Apache Falcon. Ideal if you're using Falcon to schedule jobs on Hadoop, and want a monitoring solution.

I have an idea for a feature!
